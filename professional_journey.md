# A Brief Overview of My Professional Journey

In 2004, I transitioned from civil engineering to computer science. Despite a weak foundation and a challenging learning process, I eventually met the minimum standards.

During the job search, I faced numerous challenges, and interviews made me acutely aware of the importance of algorithms. As graduation approached, I secured an algorithm-related job with leaders from Tsinghua University. By studying MIT's English algorithm videos, I gradually overcame my fear of algorithms.

In 2008, I joined NetEase to work on algorithms. Although the project didn't succeed, it sharpened my foundational skills. By 2009, I was part of a team developing NetEase’s advertising system to replace Google’s DoubleClick. The high demands pushed me to explore various solutions, and luckily, a colleague created a simple version of tcpcopy (just 300 lines of code), which helped us avoid hundreds of potential issues. Under my management for five years, the system, built from the ground up, never faced major failures. If ChatGPT bridges the communication gap between non-English and English-speaking countries, tcpcopy narrows the gap between developers and production issues. Both are powerful tools for addressing complex challenges efficiently.

In 2011, I took on the task of generalizing tcpcopy. Despite my limited knowledge of TCP, I succeeded in its transformation through logical reasoning, investing four years of effort and open-sourcing it. Although tcpcopy helped many domestic companies, my focus on this project caused me to miss out on opportunities for financial freedom.

By 2015, with tcpcopy nearing completion, I transitioned to the database field. In 2016, I entered the MySQL database middleware sector and gradually deepened my understanding of databases. In 2019, I focused on MySQL development, solving numerous MySQL issues and uncovering my potential.

On July 31, 2024, I resigned to dedicate myself entirely to writing a book. This book summarizes 20 years of experience, focusing on how to elegantly solve problems. Despite having written only 50,000 lines of effective code throughout my career, problem-solving occupied 90% of my time, relying heavily on strong logical reasoning.

Over these 20 years, my logical reasoning has continuously supplemented my foundation and knowledge system, making me an expert in problem-solving. The importance of solving problems far exceeds coding, and successfully tackling challenging issues can make you stand out in a company.

In the future, I plan to provide feedback from the book to MySQL to promote further improvements, as the content serves as a standard answer for optimizing MySQL.
